**DESCRIPTION**: CONDUCT SECURITY TESTING TO IDENTIFY VULNERABILITIES LIKE SQL INJECTION OR XSS IN A SAMPLE WEB APPLICATION.

Conducting Security Testing for SQL Injection & XSS

Set Up Tools:
Use tools like OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, or manual testing with browsers and scripts.
Ensure you have permission to test the web application.

Test for SQL Injection:
Input malicious SQL code (' OR 1=1 --, ' UNION SELECT * FROM users --) in login forms, search bars, or query fields.

Check for:
Unexpected results (e.g., bypassing authentication or retrieving sensitive data).
Database errors in responses.

Test for XSS (Cross-Site Scripting): 
Inject scripts like <script>alert('XSS');</script> in input fields or URLs.

Look for:
Script execution in the browser.
Unauthorized data access or UI manipulation.

Validate Security Measures:
Ensure input sanitization and proper encoding.
Confirm the use of parameterized queries and Content Security Policies (CSP).

Report Findings:
Document identified vulnerabilities, affected endpoints, and severity.
Provide recommendations for fixes (e.g., input validation, escaping special characters).
